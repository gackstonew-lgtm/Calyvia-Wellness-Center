## 1. Executive Summary

Calyvia Wellness Center is a psychiatric rehabilitation and addiction recovery center in Ruiru, Kiambu County, Kenya ([https://calyviawellness.co.ke/](https://calyviawellness.co.ke/)). The platform automates and safeguards the full clinical journey:
$$\text{Enquiry} \longrightarrow \text{Triage} \longrightarrow \text{Admission} \longrightarrow \text{Detoxification} \longrightarrow \text{Therapy} \longrightarrow \text{Discharge} \longrightarrow \text{90-Day Aftercare}$$

This audit establishes the baseline of all 28 modules, data models, encryption schemes, authentication boundaries, and integration endpoints to prepare a risk-managed migration to hosted Supabase.

## 2. Monorepo & Backend Architecture Topology

The application codebase is structured as a TypeScript monorepo:
- **`apps/api`:** NestJS 10.3.8 modular monolith hosting all 28 clinical, operational, and financial domains.
  - Global prefix: `/api/v1`
  - Swagger documentation: `/api/docs`
  - Global Exception Filter: `GlobalHttpExceptionFilter` (RFC 7807 compliant error format).
  - Global Audit Interceptor: `AuditLogInterceptor` logging all mutations and data access events.
  - Global Validation: `ValidationPipe` with whitelist and forbidden non-whitelisted payload checks.
- **`apps/admin`:** Next.js 14+ (App Router) clinical management portal for authorized staff (`portal.calyviawellness.co.ke`).
- **`packages/shared`:** Shared TypeScript domain types, enums, DTOs, and utility constants.
- **`prisma/schema.prisma`:** Central PostgreSQL schema containing 41 relational models and 15 domain enums.

## 4. Database Schema & Data Models Audit

- **Total Relational Models:** 41 models defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Primary Keys:** UUID v4 across all tables via `@id @default(uuid())` (mapping directly to `gen_random_uuid()` in Postgres 16).
- **Foreign Keys:** Explicit relational integrity with cascading deletes on child relations (e.g., `Patient` $\rightarrow$ `EmergencyContact`, `Admission` $\rightarrow$ `BedAllocation`).
- **Audit Trails:** Append-only `audit_logs` model capturing `userId`, `action`, `entityName`, `entityId`, `ipAddress`, and `timestamp`.
- **Timezone Standard:** All timestamp columns stored in UTC and displayed in `Africa/Nairobi` (EAT / UTC+3).

## 5. Security & Sensitive Data Controls Audit

### A. Field-Level Encryption
Under the Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019 (Sections 44–47), health and psychiatric records require heightened technical safeguards. In Calyvia:
- Sensitive clinical narratives (`substanceHistoryEncrypted`, `allergiesEncrypted`, `subjectiveNarrativeEncrypted`, `objectiveNarrativeEncrypted`, `assessmentNarrativeEncrypted`, `planNarrativeEncrypted`, `nationalIdEncrypted`) are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM**.
- In the Hybrid architecture, this encryption remains securely executed inside the backend Node.js layer using the master key from environment variables.
- In Supabase SQL migrations, encrypted columns are typed as `TEXT` to hold the serialized ciphertext + initialization vector + auth tag payload without loss of fidelity.

### B. Access Control & RBAC
The system defines 11 distinct staff roles:
1. `SUPER_ADMIN` — Full system administration and audit inspection.
2. `FACILITY_ADMIN` — Operations, staff scheduling, bed configuration.
3. `MEDICAL_DIRECTOR` — Clinical governance, case reviews, medical oversight.
4. `DOCTOR_PSYCHIATRIST` — Clinical SOAP notes, psychiatric assessments, prescriptions.
5. `NURSE` — Vital signs, detox CIWA/COWS monitoring, e-MAR dosing, shift notes.
6. `COUNSELLOR` — Psychotherapy notes, family sessions, progress goals.
7. `PHARMACIST` — Formulary management, prescription dispensing, stock batches.
8. `ADMISSIONS_FRONT_DESK` — Patient registration, triage intake, visitor logs, room allocation.
9. `FINANCE_BILLING` — Invoicing, payment receipting, M-Pesa STK trigger, financial reports.
10. `INVENTORY_STORE` — Consumables, kitchen supplies, reorder thresholds.
11. `MANAGEMENT_EXECUTIVE` — Read-only access to dashboards, bed census, and revenue analytics.

## 6. Integrations & External Services Audit

1. **Safaricom Daraja M-Pesa (Lipa Na M-Pesa Online):**
   - Endpoints: `POST /billing/mpesa/stk-push` (initiates STK push) and `POST /integrations/mpesa/callback` (idempotent receipt processing).
   - Data stored: `checkoutRequestId`, `merchantRequestId`, `mpesaReceiptNumber`, `amount`, `phoneNumber`, `resultCode`, `resultDesc`.
   - Security requirement: Callback must be verified, idempotent, and protected against replay attacks.
2. **Public Website Lead Ingestion:**
   - Ingests enquiries from `https://calyviawellness.co.ke/` into the CRM pipeline.
   - Endpoint: `POST /integrations/webhook/website-lead`.
   - Payload: Name, phone, email, substance/concern, relationship to patient.
3. **Communication Gateway (SMS & WhatsApp):**
   - Supports Africa's Talking SMS and WhatsApp Cloud API for appointment reminders and family updates.

## 7. Migration Readiness & Risk Assessment

| Migration Area | Current Complexity | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Schema DDL** | 41 models with explicit relationships | **Low** | Clean SQL DDL executed sequentially in Supabase SQL Editor (`01` through `04`). |
| **Row Level Security (RLS)** | Currently enforced in NestJS guards only | **Medium** | Enable RLS on 100% of tables in `05_rls_policies.sql`. Provide `service_role` bypass for NestJS backend while supporting staff role evaluation. |
| **Database Connections** | Single local Postgres connection | **Low** | Use Supabase Transaction Pooler (Supavisor on port 6543 with `pgbouncer=true`) for application queries and direct port 5432 for migrations. |
| **Object Storage** | Local disk / mock metadata | **Low** | Create dedicated private buckets (`patient-documents`, `medical-records`, `prescriptions`) in `07_storage_buckets.sql`. |
| **M-Pesa Callbacks** | NestJS HTTP controller | **Medium** | Keep NestJS callback endpoint active, or bridge with a Supabase Edge Function that updates the `mpesa_transactions` table. |

## 8. Conclusion & Sign-Off

The Calyvia backend is completely structured and ready for Supabase hosting. The recommended target architecture is **Option A: Hybrid** (detailed in [`ADR-001-supabase-architecture.md`](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/Calyvia/docs/adr/ADR-001-supabase-architecture.md)), ensuring zero regression to the 28 validated domain modules while gaining the managed reliability, automated backups, and security of Supabase.
